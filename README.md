## St√©phane Este-Gracias @sestegra
As an advocate for free and open-source software, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and collaboration. My passion has led me to participate in various initiatives, educating others about the benefits of using open-source software.

Leveraging my expertise in cloud-native technologies, I help teams overcome challenges, identify improvement areas, and develop successful strategies. I am committed to driving positive change and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous learning, whether working with external customers or our own internal team.

As a Cloud Native enthusiast, I am proud to continue promoting open-source software and inspiring others to join the movement.
